                <b>Strategies</b>
                <p>

                <p> Lucky for you, your mind is malleable like clay—it <i>can</i> be
                    reshaped, if
                    you are willing to <i>believe</i>
                    that it can. <br>
                    Since beliefs are long term thoughts, we can just focus on removing negative thoughts to reshape our
                    beliefs.
                <p>
                    Let’s go over <b>four</b> steps to remove negative thoughts.</p>
                <br><br>
                <b>
                    <p style="text-align: center"> Step 1: Recognizing the Problem</p>
                </b>


                We will begin with a thought experiment.
                <p>

                    Imagine it's the end of the school day, your teacher/professor announces a 10 page essay due in one
                    week. <br>
                    Consider your initial reaction, would any of these thoughts pop into your head: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>“This is unfair”</li>
                    <li>“That is too many pages”</li>
                    <li>“I do not have enough time”</li>
                    <li>“I can’t write 10 pages”</li>
                    <li>“This is too difficult”</li>
                </ul>
                If you experienced any of that, how difficult would it be to even start the essay? <p>

                    Now consider the same scenario, but instead of having any of the above reactions, you think this
                    instead: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>“Okay.”</li>
                </ul>
                That’s it. No stress. Just acceptance.<p>
                    Wouldn’t that make it easier to get started?
                <p>
                    Recognizing your thoughts toward any situation is a powerful step towards removing unwanted ideas.
                    This step alone can get you far, but let’s continue to Step 2.
                <p><br><br>


                    <b>
                        <p style="text-align: center">Step 2: Labeling the Thought</p>
                    </b>


                    When a negative thought pops up, give it a name. Labeling it helps create space between you and the
                    thought. If we use our example sentences from before, it could look something like this:
                <p>


                <ul>
                    <li>“This is too difficult” → That’s a negative thought.</li>

                    <li>“I can’t write 10 pages” → That is a negative belief.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Be careful to not fight these thoughts, we are just watching them from a distance, for now. We will
                    need a plan before addressing the thoughts.
                <p><br><br>

                    <b>
                        <p style="text-align: center"> Step 3: Acknowledging the Thought Without Judgement</p>
                    </b>

                    Now that we have given the thought a name or label, ask yourself:
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have I had this thought before?</li>

                    <li>Is this a fact, or just a feeling?</li>

                    <li>Would everyone agree this is true?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Again, acknowledge the thought without judgement. Judging a negative thought is just letting another
                    one enter through the back door. Observe without judgement, don’t beat yourself up.
                <p><br><br>

                    <b>
                        <p style="text-align: center">Step 4: Ask Yourself Reflective Questions</p>
                    </b>
                <p>
                    To quickly recap, we have:
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognized the negative thought</li>
                    <li>Given it a name</li>
                    <li>Acknowledged it without judgement</li>
                </ul>
                The purpose of these steps was to separate yourself and the thought as two different entities.
                By doing this, the negative thought is weakened. Now we can push back by asking deeper
                questions.<br>
                Here are the golden questions to ask yourself:

                <ul>
                    <li> How is this thought helping me?</li>
                    <li> What benefit will the negative thought bring?</li>
                    <li> Will it make me happy?</li>
                    <li> Will it improve my chance of success?</li>
                    <li> Will it help me to cultivate a strong work ethic?</li>
                </ul>

                Seriously consider these questions deeply, ask sincerely. The negative thought’s true self will
                be
                shown: Unhelpful, Untrue, Unnecessary. You will see the thought quickly lose power.
